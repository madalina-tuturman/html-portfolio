<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>Hello, World!I'm Mădălina, an enthusiastic engineering student from Romania with a passion for continuous learning. This time, I've decided to explore web development, discovering new challenges and skills every day. </p>

<p>I graduated high school with a focus on Natural Sciences, where programming was a vague concept for me for quite a while. I had my first real encounter with it in my first year of university, but most of my experience was with back-end development, which, to be honest, didn't captivate me as much..</p>

<p>Eager to explore the front-end side, I came across Angela Yu's course, from which I've learned everything you see here. There's a long road ahead, and I'm excited to keep discovering more, thanks to Angela's support and the resources she offers. Watch out, web development—here I come!</p>
